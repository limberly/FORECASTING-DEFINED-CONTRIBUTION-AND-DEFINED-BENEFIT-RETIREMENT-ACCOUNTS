Data
January 1, 1950 - January 1, 2018 S&P value

Return calculated as YOY percent change
YOY dividend yield from: http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/table
Assume $100,000 at age 55
Contribution rate: 9%

Binomial Tree method:

Down: 1 + (stock return - dividend - volatility)
Probability of Up: {(1+stock return - dividend) - Down} / (Up - Down)
